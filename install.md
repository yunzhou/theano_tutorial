# Installation of Theano on Windows 7 for Visual Studio 2010 for Academic use
========================================
* Install [visual studio 2010](https://www.dreamspark.com/)
* Download and install [CUDA 7.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
* Install [TDM GCC](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/)

  Theano C code compiler currently requires a GCC installation. We have used the build TDM GCC which is provided for both 32- and 64-bit platforms. A few caveats to watch for during installation:

   1. Install to a directory without spaces (we have placed it in C:\SciSoft\TDM-GCC-64)
   2. If you donâ€™t want to clutter your system PATH un-check add to path option.
   3. Enable OpenMP support by checking the option openmp support option.

* Install [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) with [Anaconda Accelerate](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/academicanaconda), which is Fast Python for GPUs and multi-core with NumbaPro and MKL Optimizations)

* Goto anaconda command prompt and pip install Theano

* Set the following environment using this setenv.bat

~~~~bat
REM configuration of paths
set VSFORPYTHON="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC"
set SCISOFT=%~dp0

REM add tdm gcc stuff
set PATH=c:\TDM-GCC-64\bin;c:\TDM-GCC-64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\bin;%PATH%

REM add anaconda env
CALL C:\Users\simuser\Anaconda\Scripts\anaconda.bat

REM configure path for msvc compilers
REM for a 32 bit installation change this line to
REM CALL %VSFORPYTHON%\vcvarsall.bat
CALL %VSFORPYTHON%\vcvarsall.bat amd64

REM return a shell
cmd.exe /k

* Create .theanorc.txt under %USERPROFILE% folder. Copy following into file.

~~~~
[global]
floatX = float32
device = gpu

[nvcc]
flags = --use-local-env  --cl-version=2010
~~~~

* Goto anaconda command prompt and Run python check1.py and you should see that you python script are using gpu.
